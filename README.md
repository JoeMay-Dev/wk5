This is a simple calendar application that utilizes the moment.js https://momentjs.com/ api to keep track of the date and time of day.

The user can log events for every hour throughout the current day starting at 
6:00 am and ending at 6:00 pm

The hour blocks are color coded as follows:
 - Past hour blocks are colored light gray
 - The current hour is colored light coral
 - Future hour blocks are colored light green

 The users tasks are saved to local storage once they click the + button so they remain available to view even if the browser is closed and reopened or refreshed
